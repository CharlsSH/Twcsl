# twcsl.js

twcsl.js is a Javascript library of common properties and methods useful for
building effects in Squarespace sites.

### Version 0.3.2

## Install Options

  * There are two options for installing twcsl on your site depending on if your
    site is on a **[paid plan][1]** or in a **[trial period][2]**. Use **only
    one** of the install options. Be sure to save the changes you make when
    given the opportunity.
    
    <a id="Paid-Plan-Install-Steps"></a>
    
    * **Paid Plan Install Steps**
    
      * **Step 1**
      
        In your web browser visit the following URL.
        
        ```
        https://d1j8mu9lowy9zf.cloudfront.net/twcsl/0.3.2/twcsl.js
        ```
        
        The **twcsl.js** file will be downloaded to your computer.
        
      * **Step 2**
      
        In **Pages > Not Linked** [add a **Link** page][3] and [link to the
        **twcsl.js** file][4].
        
      * **Step 3**
      
        Add the following to Settings > Developer Tools > Code Injection >
        HEADER.
        
        ```html
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="/s/twcsl.js"></script>
        ```
        
      * The paid plan install steps are finished.
      
    <a id="Trial-Period-Install-Steps"></a>
    
    * **Trial Period Install Steps**
    
      * **Step 1**
      
        Add the following to Settings > Developer Tools > Code Injection >
        HEADER.
        
        ```html
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        
        ```
        
      * **Step 2**
      
        In your web browser visit the following URL.
        
        ```
        https://d1j8mu9lowy9zf.cloudfront.net/twcsl/0.3.2/twcsl.html
        ```
        
        The **twcsl.html** file will display in your browser.
        
      * **Step 3**
      
        Copy the entire contents of the page and add it to Settings >
        Developer Tools > Code Injection > HEADER after the previously installed
        code. jQuery must be before the twcsl code.
        
      * The trial period install steps are finished.
      
      * *Once your site is out of the trial period you may want to switch over
        to the paid plan install. Just reverse the trial period install steps
        and then follow the paid plan install steps.*
      
## Example

You want to build an effect that does something when you are on a store category
product list page. You can use twcsl to test if you are on such a page with the
following.

```javascript
if ( twcsl.page.store.list.hasCategory ) console.log ( 'has category' );
```
