  rest of the steps.
  
* Add code from file **[add to cart button active hours.html][6]** to Settings >
  Developer Tools > Code Injection > FOOTER. Please see [Add code to code
  injection][7]. Read the code for any instructions within.

## Notes

By default the code uses Settings > Business Information > BUSINESS HOURS to
determine when the atc button is active. You can override the business hours set
in your site using settings in the code.

The button is inactive effect is minimal. You can of course use your own custom
CSS to enhance or replace what the code does. A twc-atcbah class is added to
the atc wrapper element.
