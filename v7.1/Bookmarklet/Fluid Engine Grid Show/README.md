### Synopsis

Toggle Fluid Engine grid show.

### Version

  * 0.1.0

#### SS Version

  * Yes

---

## Quick Install

* Add code from file **[fluid engine grid show.bookmarklet][2]** as the URL for
  a bookmark in your browser named **Fluid Engine Grid Show**.
  
* Edit a page with Fluid Engine sections.
  
* Use the bookmarket.

## What is a bookmarket?

Wikipedia has a nice entry on [bookmarklet][3].

## Note

The code uses a Squarespace dynamic class name. The effect will break when SS
updates their code. If the effect stops working this is probably the reason. Let
me know and I will attempt to update the code. I can not promise how quickly I
can update the code.
