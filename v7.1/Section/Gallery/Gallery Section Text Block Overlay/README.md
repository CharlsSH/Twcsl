* Add a section to a page.

  * There is no need to spend time changing the design layout of this section as
    the code will hide this section.
    
  * Add text blocks that you want to use as gallery section image text overlays.
    Use line blocks to keep text blocks from collapsing together.
    
* Add a gallery section to a page.

  * Add the gallery section just before the previous section you created.
  
  * Turn the **Captions** on.
  
  * In the first image description add the following line.
    
    ```
    twc-gstbo
    ```
    
  * For each image you want to have a text block overlay set its 
    description to a text block id. If you want an overlay for the first image
    add a line to the description that is the text block id.
