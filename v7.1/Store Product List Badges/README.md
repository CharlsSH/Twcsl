## Custom Badges

In addition to the SS built-in badges this code lets you add your own custom
badges to products. For example lets say you want to add a **pre-order badge**
to a product. Edit the product. Add a tag with the text **twc splb pre-order**.
You will now see a pre-order badge on the product list page.
