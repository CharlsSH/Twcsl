## Quick Install

* Add code from file **[asset library selected image urls.bookmarklet][2]** as
  the URL for a bookmark in your browser named **Asset Library Selected Image
  URLs**.

## What is a bookmarket?

Wikipedia has a nice entry on [bookmarklet][3].

## Note

The code attempts to open a new window/tab with a listing of selected Asset
Library image URLs. If you are using a pop-up or ad blocker, you will need to
allow pop-ups for each site where you use the bookmarklet. If you select a large
number of images, it can take a moment for the window with the URLs to open.
