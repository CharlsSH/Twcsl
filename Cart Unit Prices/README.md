# Cart Unit Prices

### Version 0.1d0

#### SS Versions 7.1, 7.0

---

## Quick Install

* Install code from
  **[Cart Prices Sqs-Money-Native Add](https://github.com/tomsWebConsulting/twcsl/tree/main/Cart%20Prices%20Sqs-Money-Native%20Add)**.
  
* Add code from file
  **[cart unit prices.html](cart%20unit%20prices.html#L1)**
  to Settings > Advanced > Code Injection > FOOTER after the **cart prices
  change** code.

## Notes

Adding unit prices to the cart page does not effect the store/product
pages, checkout, or other SS pages/backend storage. This is purely a cosmetic
change. No code can change the checkout page. It is an SS security feature.

The effect is not active on mobile.
